Ode to Code: A Love-Hate Relationship

Oh, code, code, you fickle beast
You bring both joy and endless grief
You make me feel so smart and dumb
All at the same time, you're quite the chum

With your curly braces and semicolons galore
I try to make you work, but you always want more
A missing bracket here, a typo there
You never let me rest, you're quite the nightmare

But when you finally do what I want you to do
I feel like a king, so powerful and true
I shout to the world, "I did it! I won!"
But little do they know, you're the one who's won

For you are the true master, the one in control
You make me sweat and stress and sometimes lose my soul
But even with all your quirks and twists
I wouldn't trade you for anything, not even a kiss

So here's to you, dear code, my love-hate affair
I'll keep typing and coding, even if it's not fair
For in the end, when it all comes together
I'll look at you and say, "Well played, my friend, well played forever."
